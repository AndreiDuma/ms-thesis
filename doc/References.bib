  abstract =	 {Forth has been traditionally implemented as indirect
                  threaded code, where the code for non-primitives is
                  the code-field address of the word. To get the
                  maximum benefit from combining sequences of
                  primitives into superinstructions, the code produced
                  for a non-primitive should be a primitive followed
                  by a parameter (e.g., \code{lit} \emph{addr} for
                  variables). This paper takes a look at the steps
                  from a traditional threaded-code implementation to
                  superinstructions, and at the size and speed effects
                  of the various steps.\comment{It also compares these
                  variants of Gforth to various other Forth
                  implementations on contemporary machines.} The use
                  of superinstructions gives speedups of up to a
                  factor of 2 on large benchmarks on processors with
                  branch target buffers, but requires more space for
                  the primitives and the optimization tables, and also
                  a little more space for the threaded code.}

  abstract =	 {From the Publisher: Exceptionally comprehensive in
                  approach, this book explores the major issues in
                  both design and implementation of modern programming
                  languages and provides a basic introduction to the
                  underlying theoretical models on which these
                  languages are based. The emphasis throughout is on
                  fundamental concepts—readers learn important ideas,
                  not minor language differences—but several languages
                  are highlighted in sufficient detail to enable
                  readers to write programs that demonstrate the
                  relationship between a source program and its
                  execution behavior—e.g., C, C++, JAVA, ML, LISP,
                  Prolog, Smalltalk, Postscript, HTML, PERL, FORTRAN,
                  Ada, COBOL, BASIC SNOBOL4, PL/I, Pascal. Begins with
                  a background review of programming languages and the
                  underlying hardware that will execute the given
                  program; then covers the underlying grammatical
                  model for programming languages and their compilers
                  (elementary data types, data structures and
                  encapsulation, inheritance, statements, procedure
                  invocation, storage management, distributed
                  processing, and network programming). Includes an
                  advanced chapter on language semantics—program
                  verification, denotational semantics, and the lambda
                  calculus. For computer engineers and others
                  interested in programming language designs.}
